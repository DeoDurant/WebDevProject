# WebDevProject
This is a project that uses php, html, and bootstrap css to create a Pokemon CMS. It has basic functionalities of CRUD, basic frontend validation, a login system, and is able to upload files and pictures.

Here is the login page where users are validated through the login system.

Here is the landing page, it has a table of all the pokemon's that Professor Oak has submitted so far, a picture of the pokemon, their typing, ability, notes, and the date it was discovered.
All of the sorting is being handled on the front-end so as not to make multiple calls in the database.

Here is the search functionality. When searching, it takes the user to a new page where it shows the results of the query where it exists in other tables.

Each post has a comment section where users can comment!
The layout and captcha section are not working as intended so far.
